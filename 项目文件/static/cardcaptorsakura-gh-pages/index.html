				<p>The series focuses on <span class="anime pink character">Sakura Kinomoto</span>, a fourth grade elementary school student. After opening a book in her father's library she releases a set of 19 magical cards, which start to cause different kinds of mischief. The Guardian of these cards, <span class="anime yellow character">Kero</span>, a cute magical stuffed-animal-like lion, tasks Sakura to retrieve the cards in order to avoid an unknown catastrophe from befalling the world.</p>

					<p>Sakura has one sibling, her 17-year old brother <span class="anime pink character">Toya Kinomoto</span>. He has magical powers, however, unlike Sakura, his manifest themselves with him seeing ghosts and being aware of magical beings, but also having a "sixth sense" for detecting impending threats.</p>

					<p>Sakura's father, <span class="anime green character">Fujitaka Kinomoto</span> is a college professor of archaeology at Towa University. He's extremely kind and caring, and although he's very busy with his work, he finds time for his children whenever he can. Her mother, <span class="anime green character">Nadeshiko Kinomoto</span> sadly died when Sakura was only 3. She was exceptionally beautiful and used to work as a model. In the series Nadeshiko is sometimes seen as an angel, although only Toya is able to see her.</p>
					<p>Sakura's best friend <span class="anime green character">Tomoyo Daidouji</span> designs and creates the cute outfits that Sakura wears while capturing cards. She also makes sure to record any special event with her video camera. Tomoyo's mother, <span class="anime green character">Sonomi Daidouji</span>, is the president of a big toy company, but also the cousin of Nadeshiko.</p></p>
